Project Description:
Timebridge is a simple calendar where users can create, send, and manage events while inviting others to these events. Recipients of invitations as well as the event creator receive an email upon initially creating the event, as well as another reminder at a time the creator sets. After creating the event, it appears on the creator's, as well as any recipients', calendar pages. At any point, the user may download a ".ics" file of their calendar to share with others or transfer onto another online calendar. On the home page, an interactive calendar shows every active event the user has, and they may organize it by viewing a specific day, week, or month. Events are shared between users by email, and through our UI if they have an account. Users must register for an account before logging in, and the registration only allows emails as usernames. The settings page allows users to alter their username or password, log out, or delete their account altogether. The creator of an event can include a link for the recipients to follow from the emails they receive, adding functionality for Zoom, dinner reservations, movie tickets, and other events that connect people from other devices.

All of the source code is included in the Project Source Code directory.
All meeting logs during the project are located in the TeamMeetingLogs directory.
All Milestone Submissions, including all tests and lab submissions, are located in the MilestoneSubmissions directory.
